# Findings & Recomendation

## 1. Revenue 
This contains 6 visuals, 1 card and 1 slicer 

The card shows the total revenue during the 3 month

The Slicer is to filter the visuals based on the payment method 

The visuals each had its purpose on the page 

1. Revenue by Gender: This is represented with a Clustered Bar Chart. It shows the total revenue by each gender and from the dataset the female gender seems to generate more revenue followed very closely by the male gender
